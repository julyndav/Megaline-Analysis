## Megaline Subscriber Analysis
The following project will analyize subsciber behavior to help in determining what type of model has better accuracy finding the more popular plan, Ultra or Smart.

We have access to behavior data about subscribers who have already switched to the new plans. For this classification task, we need to develop a model that will pick the right plan. Since weâ€™ve already performed the data preprocessing step, we can move straight to creating the model.

In this project, the threshold for accuracy is 0.75 and will be checked by using the test dataset.
